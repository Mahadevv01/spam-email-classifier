# Spam Email Detector

A machine learning-based spam email detector that classifies emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content. This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to build an effective spam filtering system.

## Features
- **Email Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Vectorization:** Convert email text into numerical features using methods such as TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
- **Model Training:** Supervised learning with classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
- **Prediction:** Classify new emails as spam or not spam based on learned patterns.
- **Accuracy Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

To run the spam email detector, you'll need Python and the required libraries. Here's how to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-email-detector.git
   cd spam-email-detector
